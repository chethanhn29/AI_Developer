# To Build a classification model 
The given code is about building a classification model to predict a target variable using various supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier. It also performs data pre-processing steps like checking for missing values, outlier detection, data scaling using StandardScaler, and feature selection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Below are the details of the code execution:

1.Libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.pipeline, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.decomposition, sklearn.svm, sklearn.metrics are imported.

2.The dataset is read using pd.read_csv and stored in df.

3.Missing values are checked using df.isnull().sum().

4.Outliers are detected using boxplot for each column in df.columns[:-1] and then removed using the Z-score method.

5.Pairplot and heatmap are plotted for visualizing the data distribution and correlation between the features respectively.

6.The data is split into predictor variables and target variable and then into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

7.The data is scaled using StandardScaler.fit_transform.

8.The models to be trained are defined as a dictionary with the model names as keys and the model objects as values.

9.Parameter grids for each model are defined as a dictionary with model names as keys and parameter values as values.

10.The best models are identified using GridSearchCV for each model and then evaluated on the training and testing sets using various metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall scores.

11.The model with the highest test accuracy is chosen as the final model and its best parameters are printed.

12.The logistic regression model is fit on the training data, and then predictions are made on the test set.

13.The confusion matrix, classification report, AUC score, and ROC curve are calculated and plotted using matplotlib.pyplot.
